## description 

In this final project we were tested to the limits.
I was required to work in a group of 3 to build a full stack web application using a host of technologies we have learned throughout the course.
We decide to build a gym application that would allow you to sign up and login in, leave reviews about the gym search products and book personal trainers.


## User story

Given that I am a gym lover I would like everything about my local gym at the tip of my fingers. 
So that I can browse gym gear, view workouts, leave reviews about the gym and book personal trainers.
